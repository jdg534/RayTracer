// rember render to be it's own file (not a class)


ffmpeg -r (int fps here) -y (if want to default override out file) -i "input file string" "output file string"


1. figure out how to stich the .ppm files into a video via FFMPEG, // done but need to improve, out to directory, 

2. figure out how to alter positions & size of the spheres (on a frame by frame basis)



// key frame animation, via text file  
feedback: "Good idea, will also give something to write about in the portfolio"
